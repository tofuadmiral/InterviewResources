QUESTIONS
- elevator pitch about yourself

- asked about watchsafe and about hospital app that I created 
	answer: showed them the project, explained that i couldnt show hospital stuff because of the privacy issues
- what team would you like to join? 
	answer: backend or mobile dev
- array, sum all elements of the array
	answer: coded it in java, super easy
- object oriented design
	answer: implemented an interface for a receipt item using their predefined one on codeshare
- SQL join tables, asked to make a query to design room bookings for hotels
	answer: didn't know much SQL but did the design loosely just so that I could give an answer


ASKED THEM
- what teams are there?
	answer: three: mobile dev, backend and product
- chance to get involved with design?? 
	answer: yes, very much so i.e. works closely with all teams
- why objective C instead of SWIFT?
	answer: phasing out objective C gradually 
- how will culture change w acquisition?
	answer: seperate offices, so not much. this why their hiring process has to be good
- work on both iOS and android??
	answer: yes, will work on both platforms

GOOD
- impressed by my questions, especially the culuture question
- seemed to like my answers for the array, completed that very quickly, made some jokes
- gave me a tour after the interview of their offices

IMPROVE
- KNOW SQL. THEN YOU COULD'VE GOT THE LAST QUESTION
- worry less about the android questions they could ask you and more about basic data structures and algorithms questions
- don't make the tour awkward, i.e. you said android stuff but it was actually XCODE.
