Notes from phone interview w big advertising company 

TYPE
- phone	
- large size

DIFFICULTY
- 1/5 (essentially a screen from HR)

QUESTIONS
- tell me about yourself
	answer: explained how I got into tech, why I'm applying even though im Biomedical
	- well done = talked about skills learned as well not just the path you travelled
	- answer didn't flow as well in the beginning, could possibly improve upon that.
- most skilled programming language?
	- python, java, c, swift, javascript in that order. Talked about different 
	- experiences where I had used those languages 
- compensation that you're expecting (hourly)?
	- said 25-30 an hour
	- they said to be fully transparent that it was more like 20 an hour


ASKED THEM
- talk about how long do they spend on each project? 
	- depends on project, might work on more than one at a time
- travel opportunities?
	- not as an intern except to client facing offices in the gta, but as a 
	- full time hire, can choose to work on any project that you want in the world
- local intern presentations? What are those
	- for interns, they will explain more during the job, but mostly like a
	- side project type thing

GOOD
- she said I had obviously done my research
- got second round technical assessment 

IMPROVE
- make first answer flow more, but make sure it doesn't sound forced :)
- post notes:
	got the technical assessment! Then two more video interviews with the software
	team
