- Reviewed company beforehand, had read blog and interviewer's LinkedIn account

- talk through your solution
- just start coding and then get more specific as you go
- keep in mind boundary values, etc i.e. this time didn't know if would work with negative
- Python DOESN'T USE STATIC TYPING!
- function definition in Python needs formal arguments!!!
