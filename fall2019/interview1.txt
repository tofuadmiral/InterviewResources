feedback

good:
    asking for clarification
    go through without coding, then test it
    went through the entire solution then thought about improvements
    
    
improve
    have test cases before, so you can spot the issues
    start thinking about them earlier 
    in more complicated questions that can be super helpful 
    

general tech questions
    good, asked about what happens when you put URLs into the browser
    load balancing good, CDNs good, but talk about caching, so dont hit as often
    improve performance? throttling, rate limiting, 
    
    how to handle requests:
        totally fine to mention an implementation that you're familiar with
        hitting a URL and getting to a view and controller, etc.
